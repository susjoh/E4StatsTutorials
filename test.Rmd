## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r include = F, results="hide"}
library(dplyr)

ladybirds <- read.csv("data/ladybirds.csv", header = T)
glimpse(ladybirds)

totals <- group_by(ladybirds, Habitat, morph_colour)
totals <- summarise(totals, total.number = sum(number))
totals

totals <- group_by(ladybirds, Habitat, morph_colour) %>%
          summarise(total.number = sum(number))
totals

lady.mat <- xtabs(number ~ Habitat + morph_colour, data = ladybirds)

lady.chisq <- chisq.test(lady.mat)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
