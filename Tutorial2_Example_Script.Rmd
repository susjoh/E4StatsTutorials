Here is a comment to show that I am using git!

```{r echo = F, results = "hide", warning = F, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 3}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm)) + geom_point()
```

Now to do some analysis...

## Introduction

Three species of penguins are found on three islands in the Palmer archipelago in Antarctica (Figure 1). This study will investigate variation in bill morphology in one of these species, the Adelie penguin.

## Methods

Penguin bill length and bill depth were measured in mm using calipers. The correlation between the measures was investigated using a linear regression. We also investigated sex differences in bill depth using a t-test.

```{r include=F}

# This chunk will edit the data, but will not output any text or data.
# Everything is run in the background.

penguins_edit <- filter(penguins, species == "Adelie")

# Make a results folder if you don't have one already...
dir.create("results")
write_tsv(penguins_edit, "results/1_penguins_no_chinstrap.txt")

# Run a linear regression
fit1 <- lm(bill_depth_mm ~ bill_length_mm, data = penguins_edit)
fit1 <- summary(fit1)

# Create a sex subset to remove NAs
penguins_sex <- filter(penguins_edit, !is.na(sex))

# Run a t.test  
fit2 <- t.test(bill_depth_mm ~ sex, data = penguins_sex)

```

## Results

Bill depth increased with bill length:
```{r echo = F}
fit1

```
OR...

Bill depth increased with bill length (intercept = `r fit1$coefficients[1,1]`, slope = `r fit1$coefficients[2,1]`, P = `r fit1$coefficients[2,4]`, Adjusted R^2^ = `r fit1$adj.r.squared`, Figure 2)


```{r echo = F, warning = F, message=F, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(penguins_edit, aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "Bill Length (mm)", y = "Bill Depth (mm)")
```

We also saw clear sex differences in bill depth, where males had deeper bills than females (t = `r fit2$statistic`, df = `r fit2$parameter`, P = `r fit2$p.value`, Figure 3)


```{r echo = F, warning = F, message=F, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4}

ggplot(penguins_sex, aes(sex, bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Bill Depth (mm)")
```

## Dicussion

We showed that bill length and depth are correlated, and that there is significant sexual dimorphism in this trait in Adelie penguins.
